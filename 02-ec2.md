# Compute and Storage
# EC2
Billing options:
- On Demand: pay fix rate hourly
- Reserved: contract based 1 or 3 yars term, more discount
- Spot: Bid price and flexible start and end, good for few hours/night and get good discount
- Dedicated Host: existing server bound software license


## EC2 Spot instance shutdown
- 2 mins / 120 terminations warning/notice
- app is recommended to save state, upload final logs, remove from LB 
- if we stop instance by our self it will charge full hours
- if AWS stopped, subsequent hours will no charge

## Dedicated Intance
- default: your instance runs on the shared hardware
- dedicated: your instance runs on a signle dedicated hardware
- host: your instance runs on the single dedicated host and you can configure the host by yourself

You can't: 
- defoult -> dedicated / host
- dedicated / host -> default

## Reserved instance
- Convertible Reserved Instances can be change to 
- it can be reserverd as daily, weekly, etc

Reserverd Instance types:
- Standard RIs: 75% discount
- Convertible RI: 54%
- Scheduled RIs: day, a week, or a month

You can change:
- dedicated <-> host
this can be done via CLI/API

## Dedicated VPC
You can: dedicated -> default
You can't: default -> dedicated
this can be done via CLI/API

## Migration
- Cross reggion migratoin: 
    - Create AMI from base EC2, Copy to differenet region, 
    - AMI menu -> Actions -> Copy AMI -> Select Region -> Press COPY AMI
    
    
# EBS
- termination protetion 
- default volume will be deleted automaticly
- EBS Root can't be encrypted, only new volume can be encrypted
- EBS root volume is deleted after temination by default, if you wish to keep the root volume, you could enable it in Console or CLI

EBS Types:
- General Purpose SSD
    - use case: `most work loads`
    - 1 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 16.000
    - Good for low and peak load
    - use cases: Low latency server, Dev/Test environment, System boot volume
- Provisiond IOPS SSD
    - use case: `database`
    - 4 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 64.000
    - used for super critical business
    - `high-throughput workloads`
    - Suitable For: Large database work load
- Throughput Optimized HDD
    - use case: `big data & data warehouse`
    - cheap HDD volume for frequent access and throughput-intensive workloads
    - 500 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 500
- Cold HDD
    - use case: `file server`
    - cheap HDD volume for `less` frequent access
    - 500 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 250
- EBS Magnetic
    - use case: `workloads where data is infrequently accessed`
    - 1 - 1TiB
    - iOPS 40 - 200

EBS Snapshots
- volume exists on EBS, snapshot exists on S3
- Snapshots are point in time copies of volume
- Incremental, only the blocks that have changes are moved to S3
- First snapshot take times

EBS Migration:
- Take snapshot of EBS -> Create AMI from snapshot and use AMI to use EC2 instance

EBS Encryption
- you only able to share unencrypted snapshot
- snapshots can be shared with any other AWS Account
- When EBS is encrypted, this thing will happened:
   - Data at rest inside the volume
   - All data moving between the volume and the instance
   - All snapshots created from the volume
   - All volumes created from those snapshots



EBS vs Instance Store
- Instnace store are used for ephemeral storage
- Instance store volumes can't be stopped, if the host fails the data will be gone

## EBS Limitation
- only in 1 zone
- can only attached to 1 EC2

Hipervisor on EC2:
- XEN 
- Nitro

Retrieve instance / EC2 meta data: 
- Metadata: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
- User Data: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data

# EBS Automatic Backup
- Data Lifecycle Manager: 
    - Protect valuable data by enforcing a regular backup schedule
    - Retain backups as required by auditors or internal compliance
    - Reduce storage costs by deleting outdated backups.

- Create a scheduled script to do backup using aws-cli "aws create-backup"

# EBS Cost Savings Backup
- Snapshot: Incremental backup
- Complete Backup: Full backup

# Performance Improvement
## EC2 Improvement
- `Placement Group`: allow to do low latency network communication between EC2 accors `AZ`
    - Cluster PG: 
        - group of instance within a single AZ, good for LOW network latency and throughput
        - only in 1 AZ
    - Spread PC: 
        - small number instances that should be kept separat form each other
        - can be in multiple AZ
    - only avaialbe for certain types of instances (Computes / GPU / Memory / Storage)
    - recommend homogoneus instances whithind PG
    - cant merge existing instance to PG
    - cant move existing instances
- AES-NI Intel processor that help to improve encryption performance

- EBS Performance improvement: 
    - use EBS optimized instance (M2, C4, C5, D2)
    - Change IOPS on the fly
    - Use RAID 0 to Maximize Utilization of Instance Resources
    - Initialze / Warm up EBS volume before attach to attach EBS to EC2
    - Schedule EBS Snapshot at low use period as the snapshot process effect the I/O performance
    - Avoid to setup multiple snapshot at the same time
    - Use modern linux kernel


- EBS RAID BACKUP: RAID good for performance improvement but hard to backup, to do backup do:
    - stop all app that write to array
    - flush cache
    - confirm no more write
    - take snapshot


- EFS Improvement
    - use EFS to share the large storages files 100TB in the same EC2 instances
    - use File Gateway and laverage infrequest access storage for low cost

## Limitation
EFS: Only available for EC2 Linux or On Premise Linux. For windows use Microsoft File Share.
