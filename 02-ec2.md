- General Purpose SSD
    - use case: `most work loads`
    - 1 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 16.000
- Provisiond IOPS SSD
    - use case: `database`
    - 4 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 64.000
- Throughput Optimized HDD
    - use case: `big data & data warehouse`
    - cheap HDD volume for frequent access
    - 500 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 500
- Cold HDD
    - use case: `file server`
    - cheap HDD volume for `less` frequent access
    - 500 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 250
- EBS Magnetic
    - use case: `workloads where data is infrequently accessed`
    - 1 - 1TiB
    - iOPS 40 - 200

EBS Snapshots
- volume exists on EBS, snapshot exists on S3
- Snapshots are point in time copies of volume
- Incremental, only the blocks that have changes are moved to S3
- First snapshot take times

EBS Migration:
- Take snapshot of EBS -> Create AMI from snapshot and use AMI to use EC2 instance

EBS Encryption
- you only able to share unencrypted snapshot
- snapshots can be shared with any other AWS Account

EBS vs Instance Store
- Instnace store are used for ephemeral storage
- Instance store volumes can't be stopped, if the host fails the data will be gone

- Change security group affect immediately
- EC2 instance can have multiple security group
- Security Group can have multiple EC2 ( many - many )
- Statefull
- In traffic allowd then out traffic are allowed too
- You can't block specific IP Address
- There is no Deny Rule
