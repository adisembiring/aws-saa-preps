Billing options:
- On Demand: pay fix rate hourly
- Reserved: contract based 1 or 3 yars term, more discount
- Spot: Bid price and flexible start and end
- Dedicated Host: existing server bound software license

## EBS
- termination protetion 
- default volume will be deleted automaticly
- EBS Root can't be encrypted, only new volume can be encrypted
- EBS root volume is deleted after temination by default, if you wish to keep the root volume, you could enable it in Console or CLI

EBS Types:
- General Purpose SSD
    - use case: `most work loads`
    - 1 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 16.000
- Provisiond IOPS SSD
    - use case: `database`
    - 4 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 64.000
- Throughput Optimized HDD
    - use case: `big data & data warehouse`
    - cheap HDD volume for frequent access
    - 500 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 500
- Cold HDD
    - use case: `file server`
    - cheap HDD volume for `less` frequent access
    - 500 - 16TiB
    - iOPS 250
- EBS Magnetic
    - use case: `workloads where data is infrequently accessed`
    - 1 - 1TiB
    - iOPS 40 - 200

EBS Snapshots
- volume exists on EBS, snapshot exists on S3
- Snapshots are point in time copies of volume
- Incremental, only the blocks that have changes are moved to S3
- First snapshot take times

EBS Migration:
- Take snapshot of EBS -> Create AMI from snapshot and use AMI to use EC2 instance

EBS Encryption
- you only able to share unencrypted snapshot
- snapshots can be shared with any other AWS Account

EBS vs Instance Store
- Instnace store are used for ephemeral storage
- Instance store volumes can't be stopped, if the host fails the data will be gone

Hipervisor on EC2:
- XEN 
- Nitro

Retrieve instance / EC2 meta data: 
- Metadata: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
- User Data: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data

## Security Group
- inbound traffic blocked by default
- outbound traffic allowd
- Change security group affect immediately
- EC2 instance can have multiple security group
- It operates at instance level not VPC
- Security Group can have multiple EC2 ( many - many )
- Statefull
- In traffic allowd then out traffic are allowed too
- You can't block specific IP Address
- There is no Deny Rule

# Performance Improvement
## EC2 Improvement
- `Placement Group`: allow to do low latency network communication between EC2 accors `AZ`
    - Cluster PG: 
        - group of instance within a single AZ, good for LOW network latency and throughput
        - only in 1 AZ
    - Spread PC: 
        - small number instances that should be kept separat form each other
        - can be in multiple AZ
    - only avaialbe for certain types of instances (Computes / GPU / Memory / Storage)
    - recommend homogoneus instances whithind PG
    - cant merge existing instance to PG
    - cant move existing instances
- AES-NI Intel processor that help to improve encryption performance

- EBS Performance improvement: 
    - use EBS optimized instance (M2, C4, C5, D2)
    - Use RAID 0 to Maximize Utilization of Instance Resources
    - Initialze / Warm up EBS volume before attach to attach EBS to EC2
    - Schedule EBS Snapshot at low use period as the snapshot process effect the I/O performance

- EFS Improvement
    - use EFS to share the large storages files 100TB in the same EC2 instances
    - use File Gateway and laverage infrequest access storage for low cost

# Limitation
EFS: Only available for EC2 Linux or On Premise Linux. For windows use Microsoft File Share.
